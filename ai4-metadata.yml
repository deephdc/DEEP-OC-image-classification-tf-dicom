title: Chest x-ray image classifier
summary: Classify chest x-ray images in patological and non patological with this X-ray classifier.
description: |-
  The deep learning revolution has brought significant advances in a number  of fields [1], primarily linked to image and speech recognition. The standardization of image classification tasks like the [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/) [2] has resulted in a reliable way to compare top performing architectures.

  This Docker container contains the tools to train an image classifier on your personal dataset.

  It is a highly customizable tool  that let's you choose between tens of different [top performing architectures](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-applications) and training  parameters.

  The container also comes with a pretrained general-purpose image classifier trained on ImageNet.

  The PREDICT method expects an RGB image as input (or the url of an RGB image) and will return a JSON with  the top 5 predictions.
